# Memory Game

## Project Description
A simple memory game where the users try to find the matching images.

### Motivation
I realized I didn't create anything fun lately and my protfolio needs some improvements. 

### How It Works
Array of 18 items is shuffled and rendered twice in the random order guaranteeing the render of the same image twice.
Clicks on the grid items adds the image to the clicked grid item. 

### Technology Used
*   Javascript
*   HTML
*   CSS

### Improvements and Challanges
*   Maybe keep the score between games
*   Implement a point system where the wrong clicks are punished and matches are awarded

## How to Install and Use
Clone the repository and have fun. More pics can be added by just making additions to the objects array.
Duplication, randomization and rendering is handled in "doubleAndRender" and "shuffle" methods. Changing 
the grid to suit your needs will be also necessary.
