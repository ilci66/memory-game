# Memory Game

## Project Description
A simple memory game where the users try to find the matching images.

### Motivation
I realized I didn't create anything fun lately and my protfolio needs 

### Technology Used
*   Javascript
*   HTML
*   CSS

### Improvements and Challanges
*   I need to find a better way to place the images instead of the one I'm using
*   Maybe keep the score between games
*   Implement a point system where the wrong clicks are punished and matches are awarded

## How to Install and Use
*   Clone the repository and have fun
