# Memory Game

## Project Description
A simple memory game where the users try to find the matching images.

### Motivation
I realized I didn't create anything fun lately and my protfolio needs some improvements. 

### How It Works
Array of 18 items is shuffled and rendered twice in the random order guaranteeing the render of the same image twice.
Clicks on the grid items adds the image to the clicked grid item. For now the game lets the user open 2 cards at but
match non-match logics not added yet. 

### Technology Used
*   Javascript
*   HTML
*   CSS

### Improvements and Challanges
*   I need to find a better way to place the images instead of the one I'm using
*   Maybe keep the score between games
*   Implement a point system where the wrong clicks are punished and matches are awarded

## How to Install and Use
*   Clone the repository and have fun
